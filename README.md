# THINX Front-End Engineer Challenge Instructions

---

##### General:
1. Use plain JS or jQuery for interactions. Do not use an MVC framework.
2. Make sure your code clean and well documented.
3. Make sure you have cross-browser checked your work.
4. Code with proper semantic markup, accessibility and performance in mind.

The top, middle section should appear/work the same as ssense.com products when you scroll up and down the page on desktop. The zoom feature should also work and trigger whatever image you click on.

##### All text is static, except two things on the top right section:
* Black/beige should be clickable and the checkmark should appear/disappear like real world use. On page load, Black should be checked.
* Quantity +/- should be functional.
* Size dropdown should work as well with sizes XS-XXL. **Create the size dropdown without using the `select` element.**

---

##### For mobile responsiveness, have everything stack on top of each other in this order:
1. Top product images in a carousel (like ssense).
2. product description.
3. product selector (color, size, etc).
4. bottom item images stacked below that.

###### Include your git repository so we can see progress on the task.
