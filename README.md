# THINX Front-End Code Challenge Instructions

1. The top, middle section should appear/work the same as ssense.com products when you scroll up and down the page on desktop. The zoom feature should also work and trigger whatever image you click on.

2. All text is static, except two things on the top right section:
    * Black/beige should be clickable and the checkmark should appear/disappear like real world use. On page load, Black should be checked.
    * Quantity +/- should be functional.
    * Size dropdown should work as well with sizes XS-XXL. **Create the size dropdown without using the `select` element.**

3. For smaller screens, have everything stack on top of each other in this order:
    1. Top product images in a carousel (like ssense).
    2. product description.
    3. product selector (color, size, etc).
    4. bottom item images stacked below that.


Include your git repository so we can see progress on the task.
