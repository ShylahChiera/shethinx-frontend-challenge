# THINX Front-End Engineer Challenge Instructions

---

The top, middle section should appear/work the same as ssense.com products when you scroll up and down the page on desktop. The zoom feature should also work and trigger whatever image you click on.

##### All text is static, except two things on the top right section:
* Black/beige should be clickable and the checkmark should appear/disappear like real world use. On page load, Black should be checked.
* Quantity +/- should be functional.
* Size dropdown should work as well with sizes XS-XXL. **Create the size dropdown without using the `select` element.**

---

##### For smaller screens, have everything stack on top of each other in this order:
1. Top product images in a carousel (like ssense).
2. product description.
3. product selector (color, size, etc).
4. bottom item images stacked below that.

---

##### Before you submit:
1. Have you used plain JS or jQuery for interactions?
2. Is your code clean and well documented?
3. Is your code cross-browser compatible?
4. Have you developed the challenge with proper semantic markup, accessibility and performance in mind?
